The \"misc\" (uncapitalised) folder located within MAIN are also additional content which I find useful. You can also modify or delete/replace them too.

1. Add a RigidBody node and attach car.gd from MAIN

2. Add a CollisionShape and mesh to your liking. Using 1 CollisionShape is recommended as of now.

3. Add a Position3D and name it \"DRAG_CENTRE\" and position it near the centre of mass of the RigidBody. Typically if you have a single CollisionShape (which is recommended), copy its translation coords and paste it on the Position3D.

4. Drag wheel.tscn off the FileSystem panel and parent under said RigidBody node and position it as you'd wish. Make sure to enable Editable Children in order to parent wheel meshes and stuff within the animation node. Repeat this step according to how many wheels you need.

5. Drag the tscn's from engine sound, mechanical sounds, and/or tyre sounds folders which you have copied, and parent them under your RigidBody.

To increase max speed on a gear - final drive, gear ratios, and reverse ratios are the ways to tweak it. It's also the case that higher engine redlines gives more speed.

Check out the Torque Curve Editor to know how an engine will perform on a set of variables. To know how your current car performs - select the car's RigidBody itself, go back to the VitaVehicle Interface, and click \"Import\". You can also fine-tune the variables on the right panel, and click \"Apply\" to save settings to the car you selected. The torque and power graph tells how torque is delivered on specific RPMs. The small up and down buttons next to the number boxes can be dragged likewise or clicked for precise tuning of the torque curvature.
